# hello-world
I am a graduate student pursuing my master's at the University of Notre Dame. Outside of academics, I enjoy Diving and hiking
I've been a student-athlete for the past 5 years and have been diving since I was 7. I was born in Mexico City but now call Vancouver Canada home. I earned a degree in Finance but am now focusing on business analytics with an emphasis on Sports Analytics.
